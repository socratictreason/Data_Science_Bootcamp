# Week One: Data Visualization

![alt text](eda.jpg)

## Overview:
Today we'll be walking through basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
and data visualization in python. You'll be learning the fundamentals of data analysis
and how to work with Jupyter notebooks. We'll also be walking through a cutting edge 
example of interactive data visualization using the framework Streamlit.

## Streamlit information:

Before we can run the streamlit app, we'll need to have it installed.
To install streamlit, open up a terminal (if you're on a Mac) or a command prompt
(if you're on a PC), and download streamlit by running:

`pip install streamlit`

Once that completes, you can actually run any streamlit app by running:

`streamlit run <path to streamlit python script>`

For example, if you want to run the app in this repository, you can run:

`streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rucogsciclub/Data_Science_Bootcamp/master/Week\ 1/app.py`

To run a very cool demo of an image recognition network for self driving cars (found here: https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving):

`
pip install --upgrade streamlit opencv-python
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving/master/app.py
`

If you download the app, you can run it locally by running:

`streamlit run <name of the app>.py`

from the same folder
