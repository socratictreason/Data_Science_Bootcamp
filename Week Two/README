# Week Two Data Set Challenge:

Congratulations, you work at a hot, highly funded start up - FaceLyft® - a new app that allows you to take a Lyft directly to the location someone posted a Facebook post from so you can like them in person. The CEO, COO, CTO, CFO, CPO, CXO, and COW (this is an actual cow, not a c-suite executive. Something about company culture and mascots - you don't know, you only just started working here) have requested that you - the new Data Science Guru - build a model to predict Facebook interactions so they can deploy their Lyft drivers most effectively.

Your task is as follows:

1) Download the open sourced data set of FB interactions here:
https://github.com/rucogsciclub/Data_Science_Bootcamp/tree/master/Week%20Two
(note: You can also find it here:
 https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics however there are more steps required using the dataset if you download it directly. Email us for more info if you're curious).

2) Build a multivariate linear regression model that best predicts the target column Total Interactions. Keep in mind that some of these variables will be highly correlated (ie; if you add comments, likes and shares for each comment you'll get the Total Interactions, but that's not a useful predictor).

3) Create a powerpoint presentation detailing what you found. If you weren't able to find anything, or ran into too many technical difficulties you can include that in your slides as well.

4) Send us the results + code you used!

This is a challenging project! If you have any questions please let us know and we'll answer it as soon as possible.
