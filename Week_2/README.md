## Intro to Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most tried and tested statistical methods 
used in data analysis. It ranks as <a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/tour-top-10-algorithms-machine-learning-newbies" target="_blank">
one of the most popular algorithms in data science </a>. 

This week we’re going to role play as real data scientists working for Sam Hinkie FC, a football club based in North England. We play in the Championship, the second tier of English football, and we need a striker desperately. We want a striker that fits our mold, one that is strong and fast. However, we don’t have the budget to buy a 50 million euro player. Thus we have to find a good, cheap player, without overpaying. 

We'll be using FIFA's 2019 dataset to make millions by applying concepts in data science to find the best players for the least money.
