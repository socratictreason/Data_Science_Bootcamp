# Week Two - Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most tried and tested statistical methods 
used in data analysis. It ranks as <a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/tour-top-10-algorithms-machine-learning-newbies" target="_blank">
one of the most popular algorithms in data science </a>. 

This week we'll be exploring Youtube's <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new" target="_blank"> "Trending Videos" </a> dataset. Building off of the work 
last week in exploratory data analysis, we'll take a look at how we can use predictive models,
such as Linear Regression, to extract additional information from our data, to uncover useful,
hidden relationships.

In the data file you'll find the original US dataset (if you're interested in exploring more, the original Kaggle dataset
contains statistics for a number of different countries), some relevant JSON data, and a file called USvideos_proc.csv. 
We'll be working with USvideos_proc.csv.
