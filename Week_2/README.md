# Week Two - Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most tried and tested statistical methods 
used in data analysis. It ranks as <a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/tour-top-10-algorithms-machine-learning-newbies" target=_blank>
one of the most popular algorithms in data science </a>. 

This week we'll be exploring Youtube's "Trending Videos" dataset. Building off of the work 
last week in exploratory data analysis, we'll take a look at how we can use predictive models,
such as Linear Regression, to extract additional information from our data, to uncover useful,
hidden relationships.
