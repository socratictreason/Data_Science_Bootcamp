# Welcome to Week 0!
## Content overview:

In the Week 0 slides you'll see an overview of this course, including:

    - Who's running this whole thing anyways?
    - What will I get out of this?
    - How do I get started?
    - Do you guys have a GroupMe I can join, or something?

Once you go through those slides, we recommend you download <a href="anaconda.org"> Anaconda </a>. This contains all the software you'll need to get started.
You'll also find a Jupyter notebook containing a brief introduction to Python, and some libraries in python that are particularly useful in data science.

Enjoy!
